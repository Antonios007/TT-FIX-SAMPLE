TT-FIX-SAMPLE
=============

Sample application to demonstrate using QuickFix open source FIX engine to connect to a TT FIX Adapter

The original version of this code was tested against [TT FIX Adapter](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/fix-adapter) version 7.65.  The [QuickFix](http://quickfixengine.org) C++ DLL with .NET wrapper was used for this codebase.

**TODO**
- Refactor to use [QuickFix/n](http://www.quickfixn.org/) .NET FIX engine
- Conform to latest production release TT FIX Adapter
- Add functionality to demonstrate [Order Staging](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/en/products/trading-analytics/xtrader/xtrader-orderstaging/)
